Hey, I'm Magne Tenstad ğŸ‘‹
I am a [Computer Science](https://www.ntnu.no/studier/mtdt) student and teaching assistant at NTNU, Trondheim. I also work part-time as a web developer at [Norsonic](https://web2.norsonic.com/). My hobby projects are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/magnetenstad), and I have published the game [CoderBear](https://store.steampowered.com/app/994360/CoderBear/) on Steam. I am currently seeking an internship for the summer of 2023.

		In the autumn of 2021, I was a student assistant in TDT4110 - [Information Technology, Introduction](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TDT4110#tab=omEmnet). I got my first internship the following summer, at [Norsonic](https://web2.norsonic.com/). This autumn (2022), I have continued working part-time for Norsonic, as well as working as a teaching assistant in TDT4121 - [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TDT4121#tab=omEmnet). At Norsonic, I work on [Norcloud](https://web2.norsonic.com/product_single/norcloud/), a cloud service used to collect, display and process sound level data.
