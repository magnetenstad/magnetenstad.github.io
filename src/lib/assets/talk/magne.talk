		%{ I've always like to create things. Back in elementary school, I liked to draw and paint, both traditionally and digitally. In middle school, I was introduced to game programming, and in high school I started publishing games. Since then, I've had a growing interest for all kinds of software. }
		My main creative hobbies over the years, have been programming💻, games🎮, and art🖌️.
